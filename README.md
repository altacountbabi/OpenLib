# OpenLib

OpenLib is a library for roblox executors that executors to interact with openai text generation models and a few other open source models such as `vicuna-13b llama-13b alpaca-13b fastchat-t5-3b` and more! This library uses a reverse proxy created by PawanOsman#0001, you will need an api key from his [discord server](https://discord.gg/pawan-krd-1055397662976905229), dont worry its free, for free you will get 250 credits per day, this is around 1.25mil chat completion tokens.

If we get 5 stars I will try to make it work on normal roblox games too!
